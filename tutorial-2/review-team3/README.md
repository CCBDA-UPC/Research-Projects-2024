## Report

The inclusion of helpful links to Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS documentation, as well as other learning resources, is a great addition.

The overall structure of the tutorial was good, and both easy to read and follow, starting from basic concepts and gradually building up to more "complex" deployments. Thanks for all the visual aids! They made navigating AWS a lot easier.

Giving a background to Docker was nice, and nothing ever felt over-explained. Perhaps it would be nice to show how to install Docker as well? One of the commands suggests using `docker-compose`, but `compose` us iccurently supported in the latest `docker` package out-of-the-box. However, you write `docker compose` above, so to this is just nitpick. Also, continuing on Docker, mentioning Docker Swarm could add a valuable perspective by showing another method of container orchestration.

The tutorial was very hands-on, which we think is a good way to learn.

The topic in itself is interesting and suprisingly easy to get started with. This tutorial made us wanting to learn more and perhaps utilize it more ourselves!

## Presentation

The structure of the presentation was good, and easy to follow.

Everyone seemed well prepared, and by explaining everything clearly to the audience it also seemed like everyone had a good understanding of the topic.

The actual "tutorial" part was a bit short. However, we don't consider this to be an issue, as everything became clear through the report.

## Conclusion

All in all we think it was an interesting and concice tutorial that gave us a good basic understanding of Kubernetes and AWS-EKS. We grade the tutorial **10/10**.
