# Review of Team 5 AWS SageMaker Tutorial 
<b> by Andreja Andrejic </b>

## Feedback
The tutorial is well elaborated and interesting. It it simple enough, but still manages to paint a clear picture of SageMaker; how to use it and
what to use it for. The code is well organized and explained clearly, so I was able to quickly understand each part, as well as the whole process.
Everything worked on the first try and even the parts which take more time to execute are noted, keeping the high quality of user experience
throughout the tutorial. The only improvement I can think of is adding a personal opinion and public criticism, perhaps mentioning a few projects
that use AWS SageMaker. All around great project, captivating and easy to follow.
