First we start by downloading the web app and we continue by creating an virtual environment where we also add the packages awscli and awsebcli. We open the learner lab and we add in the web app our credentials.
We change every where our credentials, also copy the same output from ~/.aws/credentials from your Learner Lab to our local machine in the same fie ~/.aws/credentials. The tutorial continues by sugesting to
run the bash script create.table.sh we proceeded by executing the command. 
The next step is running the bash command eb init -i. Here the following promt appears ![image](https://github.com/asfandabbasi/secondcity/assets/95017313/76b10bc5-f014-4c60-9519-674e16162d7b)
We tried providing the credentials but it would not accept it.
Then we tried executeing ebcreate.py. We get the output from the previous command and we execute that as well

Here we get an error "ERROR: NotAuthorizedError - Operation Denied. The security token included in the request is invalid."

After trying multiple fixes and restarting the learners lab many times we still couldn't use the commands and continue the tutorial because of the role errors.


# CCBDA-ResearchProject-4: CloudWatch Monitoring

In this lab, we used CloudWatch to monitor our cloud infrastructure. CloudWatch Dashboards are essential for visualizing the status, quantities, costs, and other characteristics of cloud resources to facilitate better control over them.

## Task 1: Deploy a Web App

We began by downloading the provided web application and creating a virtual environment. Within this environment, we installed the necessary packages `awscli` and `awsebcli`.

Next, we obtained our AWS credentials from the Learner Lab by running `cat ~/.aws/credentials` and used these credentials to update the `env.txt` file within the unzipped web app folder.

We ensured our credentials were correctly copied to both our Learner Lab and local machine in the `~/.aws/credentials` file.

To set up the DynamoDB table, we ran the bash script `create.table.sh`.

Then, we initialized the Elastic Beanstalk environment with the command `eb init -i`, following the prompts to configure the environment. However, we encountered the following prompt:  
![eb init prompt](https://github.com/asfandabbasi/secondcity/assets/95017313/76b10bc5-f014-4c60-9519-674e16162d7b)

Despite providing the correct credentials, the initialization was not successful.

Next, we attempted to run the `ebcreate.py` script. We executed the command generated by this script:  
![eb create error](https://github.com/asfandabbasi/secondcity/assets/95017313/c3cc802d-b039-4351-ab88-c9fcf8c185cf)

Unfortunately, we encountered an error: `ERROR: NotAuthorizedError - Operation Denied. The security token included in the request is invalid.`

Despite trying multiple fixes and restarting the Learner Lab several times, we were unable to resolve the role errors.


## Task 2: CloudWatch

We started by creating a custom dashboard:

Then we added a plot to see the health status of an Elastic Beanstalk environment:

Next, we added a widget for the metrics in DynamoDB:

Furthermore, we added graphs showing metrics derived from the logs of our application:

The next step is to use AWS CloudWatch to create an alarm for the health of the Beanstalk application:

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, due to persistent issues with AWS credentials and role permissions, we were unable to fully evaluate the tutorial. Despite our efforts to troubleshoot and restart the Learner Lab multiple times, the authorization errors prevented us from completing the deployment and monitoring tasks as intended. As a result, we could not fully explore and utilize CloudWatch's capabilities to monitor our web application.
